## Assignment-3 (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU) -->

The assignment involves image classification using CNN and sentiment analysis using RNN, LSTM and GRU.

The first question is classification on CIFAR10 dataset.  You can refer [this page](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) for downloading the dataset. For Keras, follow this [link](https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_cnn/).
The datasets for the second question  consists of two text files "train.txt" and "test.txt". The dataset does not contain  the target vector. Create the target vector as per the assignment question.
