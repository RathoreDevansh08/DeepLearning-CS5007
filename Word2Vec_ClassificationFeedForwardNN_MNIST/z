Assignment-2 (Word2Vec and Classification using Feed Forward Neural Networks) -->

The assignment involves using Word2Vec and classification using feed-forward neural network.
Submit the code as Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with outputs and results.
For the first question you can use scikit-learn.
For the second question, use Tensorflow or Keras.
You need not explicitly download any of the datasets. Use built-in functions to fetch the datasets.
